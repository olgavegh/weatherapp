## Overview

This weather application provides real-time weather updates and forecasts. Users can search for weather information by city, receiving data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a detailed five-day forecast. The application is designed to display weather details for a default location, Budapest, upon initial visit.

## Technologies Used

-   **JavaScript**: For handling the application's logic and DOM manipulations.
-   **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
